## This two functions below do fasten the process of inversing a matrix  
## by taking advantage of the caching techinque

## makeCacheMAtrix does create a special matrix object that caches the inverse of a given matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## cacheSolve does look into the cached matrix and if the current matrix is already cached, 
## returns the cached inverse matrix. If not, does compute the inverse and return it

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
